## Privacy is Dead

Privacy is dead.  What little you currently think you have will soon be gone.

Initially this was an online phenomenon.  It took two forms:

1. Search Data - Your searches taken as a group uniquely identify you.  This was shown when [AOL released search data for academic research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak).  The take away is that your search engine knows who you are.  You can try to thwart this by turning off browser features like cookies and javascript.  You can try the TOR browser, but ultimately your online behavior will identify you
2. Email - Your email provider is reading your email.  They are.  They'll say they aren't, but what they really mean is that a human could never read through all the email they host, so they have a computer do it instead.  Currently that's used to serve ads at you.  The use cases are only going to expand in the future.  Go take a look at [google's recent terms of service](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/10/11/google-to-sell-user-profiles-and-photos-in-ads/) if you have any doubts.

The phenomenon is only expanding.  It's taking hold in meatspace too.  The disappearance of privacy will not take a top down approach.  I just wandered through a TSA checkpoint with 5 people working and 10 observing things on monitors.  That is not the future.  Instead, these jobs will all be automated, with humans handling exceptions, not the core process flow.

Currently meatspace video surveillance is all about deterrence. The UK is the best example of this.  [This old article from the Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/02/cctv-cameras-watching-surveillance) gives 1 person / 32 CCTVs in the UK.  The number is only going to rise.  Currently very little is done in real time with this data.  Instead, if something bad happens (bombings of public places seem a common theme), then law enforcement rifles through hours of video searching for the perpetrator.  The Boston Marathon Bombing is a clear example of this.

Surveillance is going to go real time.  Techniques like facial recognition and gait analysis will make this possible.  The proliferation of cameras will make it inevitable.

I'm not convinced this will be driven out of the government sector.  While there are an awful lots of security cameras around, there are a bunch more embedded in phones, laptops and tablets.  This trend is only going to accelerate.  In the near future your every moment will be enacted in front of multiple cameras.  This will make it possible to not only uncover your every move, but to also model it in great detail, possibly even in 3D with zoomable features like in many sci fi crime movies.

[William Gibson said "The future is here -- It's just not evenly distributed."](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson)  This is a powerful statement when thinking about Google Glass.  Today a handful of people are wandering around with development kits for these things.  When they go GA, it's going to be big.  Maybe Google will pull this off, if not someone else will.  Regardless, in a couple years, many people are going to be wandering around with a camera stuck to their head full time.  [The first porn has already been recorded using these things](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/24/google-glass-porn_n_3644321.html).  Once again, implications for a privacy advocate are not rosy.

The implications can be broken into two groups:

1. Implications for your privacy --- you have a camera stuck to your head and a GPS embedded in the phone in your pocket.  Between search, mail and facebook your entire life is easily available online.  Everything you do is public.  
2. Implications for the privacy of others -- because you have a camera stuck to your head, it's really easy to feed the faces of everyone you meet into a facial recognition algorithm that then looks up information about whoever you are looking at.  Pickup lines have never been easier.  Being "bad at remembering names" is a thing of the past.  Even inanimate objects are now a piece of cake -- open the over wearing a camera and a HUD tells you how hot the roast is.  When you walk up to your car, the glasses notice your tires could use some air and prompt you.  Tele prompters will soon be obsolete.

There will be a backlash to this.  There already is.  Ubiquitous use of google glass currently brands you as a [glasshole](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlfZ9FNC99k).  That's going to change:

1. Using a cell phone in a restaurant used to be unthinkably rude.  Now [9% of Americans have apparently used their cell phone while having sex](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2421747,00.asp).  People are going to get used to seeing glasses everywhere.
2. Contacts.  Glasses suck.  I had to start wearing them in 7th grade.  In high school I got contacts.  Less nerdiness, more peripheral vision --- it was great.  The same is going to happen with Google Glass and subsequent technologies.  They are going to shrink until they become unnoticeable.  [People are already working on this](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/515666/contact-lens-computer-like-google-glass-without-the-glasses/).

We are conditioned from a young age to think of privacy as both a good and necessary thing.  A right to privacy is even baked into our legal system in various ways, one of the more obvious being the idea of "innocent until proven guilty."  The song [Long Black Veil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Black_Veil_(song)) provides some interesting ideas about what could happen.  Technology is going to force change here.

[Robert Sawyer's Neanderthal Parallax Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Neanderthal_Parallax) provides a picture of what a society without privacy could look like.  The best part: it actually looks pretty nice.
