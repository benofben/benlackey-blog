##Online Courses

The day my printed college course catalog arrived before my freshmen year was very exciting.  I spent the afternoon reading about specialized courses that sounded incredibly interesting.  Foundations of Math!  An entire class dedicated to Church's Theorem, Incompleteness and other nifty things!

It turns out those courses were quite difficult.  A lot of them were cross listed as graduate courses.  I learned a lot, but my GPA suffered.  My career probably would have been better served by cynical advice like this: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-ace-all-classes-college-2013-10

I did experience some bright spots in education.  The [Choice Program at Platt Middle School](http://choiceprogram.edublogs.org/about/) was great.  Graduate school at the Colorado School of Mines was interesting too.  Courses weren't fun though.  I much preferred (and still do) reading and talking with people as a way of learning.

I'm excited about online learning.  A colleague introduced me to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) a couple years ago.  I liked the style, but the subject material was pretty basic.  That's changing.  My favorite thing about Khan Academy is the approach on their new site --- lots of questions, answer them until you get 5 in a row correct.  That approach coupled with the classroom method described in this TED talk seems great, and a lot like a geometry class I really enjoyed.

I'm currently trying an [operations management course through Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/operations-003/class/index) that has the Wharton name attached.  The material is interesting, though I wish the homework assignments took the Khan Academy approach.  I really like the real time feedback, particularly when there is no classroom.

It seems clear that online learning is the future.  The costs are lower, the reach wider and in many (most?) cases the quality of instruction is higher.  It may even erode brick in mortar in much the way Amazon has changed retail, perhaps even changing to a state like that described in [Ready Player One](http://readyplayerone.com/).

Online learning also fits well with continuous learning.  Rather than working on a night time executive MBA of dubious value, it is already possible to cherry pick from various online sources.  I wonder if formal credentials will become less important in the future.  That, or perhaps we will see micro credentials, somewhat analogous to micro payments.  Either way, I wonder if the four year college degree is going to get cut into smaller increments.

I for one welcome our new online courses.  Give me more small chunks of easily digestible knowledge and I'll spend my evenings learning about [operations management](https://class.coursera.org/operations-003/class/index), [marketing](https://class.coursera.org/marketing-001/class/index) and whatever else is out there.
