## Cost of Housing

What if housing cost nothing?  Where would you live?

Or maybe something less traditional, like a 300 sqft tiny house?  If there is no cost to housing, the use of housing to demonstrate status disappears.  A 5000 sqft McMansion doesn't show that you're successful, it simply shows you have no taste (or perhaps a well tuned sense of irony once the Hipsters catch on).

A few trends are conspiring to draw down the cost of housing:

1. [Improving Transportation](http://comingdownthepipe.blogspot.com/2015/10/self-driving-cars-and-suburbs.html)
2. Mobile work and Internet Connectivity - Skype, Google Hangouts, etc...
3. Really interesting construction techniques

Let's focus on number three...

[It's now possible to print a house, or at least the rough outline, using a 3d printer and concrete](http://www.totalkustom.com/).  That's missing all the things that make a house nice --- plumbing, electric, HVAC...  but the raw outline is there.  And 3d printers are improving.  Numerous companies are working on 3d printing chips.  If it's possible to embed fine lines of conductors and transistors in silicon with a 3d printer, sticking a pipe or wire in some concrete doesn't seem like a big deal.

In this brave new world, you poke around the internet, find a model for a house you like, tweak it a bit and then call up a cement truck with a spool or wire to embed in the walls as it prints.  You hook the printer up to the truck and come back a week later to a printed house to your specs.  Total cost -- land + truck load of cement and other materials + appliances.  Cost per square foot probably drops from $100 to $10.

And that's the fully finished approach.  There's an easier, intermediate approach where some assembly is required.  This is explored excellently in a [short story by Cory Doctorow](http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/story/the-gadget/).

People demonstrate their taste and style today by decorating.  In some cases they build their own furniture, but mostly they buy it.  Houses are even less customized than furniture.  Basically all you can do is change the paint or doorknobs.  In a world of wide spread printing that all changes.  Everything is customizable and can be done so easily and cheaply.  Every choice you make becomes not about brand consciousness, but about your own style and taste.

Brands will try to bend this to their own desires.  In a world of rampant 3d printing, you may pay $1000 for a model of a Crate and Barrel dresser with an extremely restrictive EULA and DRM to ensure you don't pass it on to your friends.  Bit torrent will have furniture and houses instead of music and videos.  And intellectual property lawsuits will result in your house being deemed in breach of copyright law.
