## Self Driving Cars and Suburbs

Cities are on the rise.  Even Detroit is coming back in some minor, [hipster](http://www.vice.com/read/detroit-is-already-starting-to-gentrify) / [maker](http://www.makerfairedetroit.com/) driven way.  Seattle has done the hockey stick population thing and property values seem to be trending the way of the Bay Area in the city proper.  The 25-35 demographic prefers the city, walking and condos or townhouses to 3000 sqft lawns.

That may change.

Self driving has come a long way since every entrant failed the [DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Grand_Challenge_(2004)#The_results).  Now without the aid of CMU or MIT students your $100k Tesla can mostly drive itself.  Today this takes the form of a sort of self adjusting cruise control.

There are numerous technical reasons why the technology is going to advance very quickly.  Google's efforts already demonstrate that it's possible.  The Tesla seems to have been designed so they can push software updates without costly and time consuming hardware updates.  Suppose that in a few years cars can really, meaningfully drive themselves.  I also believe that electric cars dominating is an inevitability.  If you buy all that, what happens next?

Cities may start to recede again.  I believe cities exist for two reasons:

1. To provide economies of scale and the collaboration necessary for industrial and commercial endeavors from manufacturing to banking.
2. As a cultural gathering place where art becomes possible due to a large population able to support the overhead of artistic activities.

Both these points are being eaten away by various forms on online collaboration (Skype, Webex, Github).  However, those points will remain with us for at least the next 5-10 years.

If you assume the city is necessary for work, then you are left with two options:

1. Density (as my generation seems to be leaning toward)
2. Commute (as the boomers seemed to prefer)

With self driving electric cars, your commute could be very different.  Get home in the evening, and plug the car in.  It spends the night sipping cheap 2am power off the smart grid or maybe draining the power cells in your basement that solar panels charged all day.

Wake up at 4am and sleep walk to your car.  Pass out into a seat better than Emirates 1st class and wake up five hours later at the office.

How much distance might be covered in that time?  Commuters in Seattle could live on ranches in Tri-Cities or tree houses in the Olympics.  Suddenly Hartford would look like a minor commute to New York.  Wales to London?  No problem.

The geography of cities could change.

The American Dream is largely about freedom, mobility and wide open spaces.  RVs have been a big part of that.  Imagine a solar powered, self driving RV where the solar panels are efficient enough that the RV can drive continuously.  Populations of the retired might live in these traveling continuously, rather than stopping in RV parks as they do today.

Of course, all that driving leads to a lot of wear and tear on the roads, drivetrain and engine, even if it is just an electric motor.  How long will it be before our retired are living in self driving blimps with solar powered motors to drive them around?

As these trends emerge, cost of production is dropping precipitously.  If a blimp-RV cost $100k and could support you indefinitely in greater style (and less mold) than a sailboat, everyone with the mobility itch will get one of those.

Of course, some of us still like lavish homes and gardens.  Or in the case of density, entire floors of skyscrapers.  With cheap, high speed transport, density is no longer about poverty, but free association -- the choice to live near people you like, whether you chose a 5000 sqft McMansion in Cle Elum or a 100 sqft treehouse in a 500 year old redwood in the Olympics.

These trends, coupled with employers increasingly willing to let employees work from home is changing the primary focus of cities from industry to art.  In 50 years, cities may no longer be places you are forced to live, but elect to live in or travel to.
