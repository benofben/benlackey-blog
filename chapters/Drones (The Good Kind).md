## Drones (The Good Kind)

The US military is up to some pretty terrifying shit with drones of both the [flying](http://www.airforce.com/interactive/uav/index.html) and [running](http://www.bostondynamics.com/) kind.  If no (good) people are getting killed in our wars because they're fought entirely with robots, it'll be pretty easy to slip even deeper into the perpetual state of war we already seem to enjoy.

On the civilian side, police departments are trying to figure out how to use drones.  Police departments seem purposely vague about what they're going to be used for.  The approach seems a lot like the UK approach to CCTV -- let's just set up a bunch and see what happens.  Clearly, this isn't great if you're a privacy advocate.

All that is quite Orwellian, but these things could be used for good too.

One happy use case would be for package delivery.  Instead of loading up a FedEx truck every morning and then sending it for deliveries, FedEx could just have a fleet of drones continuously delivering packages as they arrive.  [They're already thinking about it](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-drones-are-coming-2012-12).

Of course, regulators are cautious.  While we're apparently fine with the military doing whatever it feels like, the idea of actually benefitting from drones is less popular.  It looks like they are going to be [heavily regulated](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4821094/remote-aircraft-pilot-fights-faa-fine-could-change-drone-rules).

Rules are already in place prohibiting running a drone out of line of sight.  Such rules presume this things are manually driven, not automated.  So, two strikes for the law: (1) requiring a person (2) requiring LOS

Regulation like this will reduce innovation related to drones from large companies.  It will also eliminate innovation from individuals and startups as they will find it difficult to foot the compliance costs.  Individuals and small companies are the ones most likely to do really cool stuff with an emerging technology like this -- stuff that the rest of us haven't even thought of yet.

The end result is depressing --- the US is on a path to drive drone related innovation abroad.  I wonder if we'll soon be reading about the first drone package deliveries in China or Singapore.
