## Efficient Markets

The [efficient market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) seems to be falling out of favor.  Markets are increasingly electronic.  Specialists are all but gone and the paper based trading floors are mostly a thing of the past.  Markets still aren't perfectly efficient though and it seems likely they never will be.

Each increase in efficiency (the telegraph, number boards, electronic quotes, HFT) makes possible a new style of trading that was previously impossible.  That new style can then harvest inefficiencies created by the latest technological advancement.  I suspect it's a Zeno's paradox kind of environment where for any given trade the inefficiency is trending to zero, but there is so much volume and it's so simple to scale that there are always opportunities for liquidity providers to pay the bills.

There are concerns that markets will be entirely automated, with machines buying and selling from each other in millis and micros.  In this future, a naive pensioner wanders to their local brokerage and is quickly relieved of their life savings.  And this is a very real concern, if the pensioner is trying to scalp against a machine on their home PC.

It's not a concern if people are investing.  In that case, the machines are a blessing.  For the most part they make markets more efficient and more liquid.  Occasionally they go haywire and there's a flash crash.  If you're an investor who watches the tape, that might be an excellent time for a machine-gouging limit order.

One lesson from the advent of the machines --- market orders are a terrible, terrible idea.  Don't use them.  Of course, that's probably been true as long as there have been unscrupulous characters in the market --- forever.

A real worry is hedging.  There's a certain similarity to what happened with portfolio insurance in the 80s...  Machines hedging cause markets that one would think are uncorrelated to become tightly correlated.  This can lead to very strange things happening as a capital/liquidity shortage in one market forces participants to liquidate their holdings on the other side of the world.  Suddenly shares of Ford and tightly coupled with the movements of Indian curry futures...  and that's another example of these meta-effects.  As machines hedge and trade away, picking up pennies in front of the steamroller, they open the door for market participants who have fundamental views of the underlying to make their move.

This was originally intended to be a bit more structured, but sort of devolved into a poorly cited rant.  Perhaps I will come back to it later...
