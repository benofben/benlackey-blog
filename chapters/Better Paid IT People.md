## Better Paid IT people

I had an interesting conversation about trends in computing devices recently.  A friend argued that the less than 30 crowd largely doesn't know how to use a computer.  Most depend on mobile devices and tablets for their computing needs.

Their computer skills have developed in walled garden environments.  They've never had to reinstall an OS, write an Excel macro or really do anything more complicated than go to the app store.  The argument is that digital natives aren't good for much more than playing with an iPhone.

I'd be really curious to see statistics supporting this, but my anecdotal experience seems to agree.  With the exception of people in computer science or related fields, laptop ownership seems surprisingly low.  Many people I know do own laptops, but they are ancient, unused and live in a cupboard.  Desktop ownership is near nil (a statistic I now personally contribute to).

Suppose you buy this hand waving argument -- then what?

Well, my friend argues computer jobs are about to get more valuable.  As the 20-30 crowd continues to try (and in many cases fail) to find a place in the professional workforce, the 30-50 crowd who grew up fooling around on Linux and building kitted out gaming rigs is going to find their general purpose computer savvy in increasing demand.

If the US were the only country around, I might buy this argument.  However, as long as STEM graduates are willing to move to the US, those immigrants can fill the gap in the US workforce.  I suspect immigration will moderate the wage increases for 30-50 IT experts.

That leaves the question of what happens to the relatively unemployable 20-30 crowd, but that's not exactly a novel concern.  It seems possible that a digital native of a walled garden is no more employable than a Jane Austen heroine.  Of course, curmudgeons decades my senior are probably making the same comments about my assembly and COBOL skills...
