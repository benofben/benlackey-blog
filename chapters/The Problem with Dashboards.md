## The Problem with Dashboards

Analytics is a terrible term.  There’s advanced analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, business analytics, and so on…  All these terms come loaded with massive historical baggage courtesy of the word analytics.

To a large number of people, including me, analytics is inextricably tied with business intelligence.  And, business intelligence is inextricably tied to dashboards.  Users gain insight from BI tools by sitting interacting with a GUI.

The problem with dashboards is that someone has to look at the things.   This leads to a number of issues:

It’s expensive – for each new dashboard, you now need someone staring at it, waiting for an indicator to tick up, or down, or sideways.  At that crucial point, your dashboard watcher springs into action.  How do they do that?  Do they run down the hall to alert the business?  Send an email?  That brings us to our next concern.

It’s inaccurate – I spent the holidays back in Colorado, where I spoke with a man who builds machine learning systems for making parole decisions.  I asked him how the accuracy of those systems compares to humans making the same decisions.  Once he’d stopped laughing, he explained the dismal state of human parole decisions.  As an example, apparently if you go up to the parole board before lunch, you’re almost certainly denied.

When presented with a smorgasbord of statistics, people choose to gleefully ignore them and rely on intuition.  The results are typically suboptimal, particularly from the perspective of a prisoner working toward parole.

In many cases it’s impossible – For data of any significant size and velocity, the dashboard approach probably isn’t going to work at all.  One great example of this is credit card fraud.  One approach – every credit card transaction could pop up on a dashboard where a credit fraud expert makes the decision whether or not it’s fraudulent.  They would need to do this work with a latency measured in milliseconds, 24 hours a day.

For transaction processing, retail customer service, resource scheduling and optimization and many other core business use cases it is impossible to leave a person in the core workflow and still achieve a competitive business result.

Examples range across payment processing, retail banking, online retail at Amazon, targeted advertising from Google, and on…  The businesses that remain competitive are the ones who have figured out how to build machine learning into their core workflow.  Businesses that rely heavily on human workflow steps have an inferior cost structure.  This leads to a predictable result, even without leveraging machine learning.

### Speed Read (with apologies to Bill Gross)
* Analytics is an overloaded term
* Dashboards are legacy
* The most successful businesses today rely on machine learning in their core business processes to automate previously manual steps.
