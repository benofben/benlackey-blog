# The Future I was Promised

## American Fusion

The television show opened with a voice over images of fires, riots, forests being cut:  “This is not the future I was promised… poverty, homeless camps, zero sum environmentalism, a collapsing industrial base and nationalism resurgent.”

Images of economic collapse faded, replaced by a well dressed man – khaki suit, matching blue tie and pocket square, wearing a felt fedora.  His voice was deep, reassuring…  He sat at a desk, the image of Earthrise behind him.  The man’s appearance was curated, a conscious callback to the golden era of broadcast news.

He continued:  “The future I was promised has Pan Am flights to the moon, floating cities, the elimination of poverty, a virtual Coney Island of the Mind!”

“My name is Aaron Brownfoot.  I’ll introduce you to the builders, the visionaries and the artists who are making our future possible.”  The image cut to Aaron standing in a somewhat barren field with another man.

“Today, we’re outside of Richmond, Washington, meeting with Keith P. Apple, an engineer at Endless Energy.  Keith, can you tell us what we’re looking at?”

“Behind us is Boston Cream, sometimes referred to as BC.  It’s the largest fusion reactor west of the Mississippi.”

The camera panned out to show a metallic torus, 70 meters in diameter and 20 meters high.  The donut was covered in gangways and cables.  Workers in white and yellow hard hats scrambled all over.

“Keith, how much power does BC put out?”

“The reactor is what’s referred to as a Tokamak.  The original design was formulated by the Soviets in the 50s.  The 1950s that is.  Oleg Lavrentiev came up with the theory.  Later initial experimental work was led by a team including Andrei Sakharov.   …anyway… to answer your question, peak output is approximately 100,000 megawatts.”

“Can you put that into perspective for our viewers?”

“Oh, sure.  100,000 megawatts is 100 gigawatts.  This baby has enough power to send 82.6 souped up Deloreans to the year 1955.”

“I feel like you might have used that line before.”

“Guilty as charged.”

“Would you be able to help our viewers out with a slightly less fictional comparison?”

“Ok, ok.  Geez…  So, just up the road from us was the Grand Coulee Dam.  It was what’s referred to as a low dam, focused on power generation only, not irrigation.  So, it stood about 90 meters tall.  Perhaps more impressive, the entire Columbia River flowed through it.  …anyway… that feat of Depression Era engineering produced 6,809 megawatts.  So, BC here is over 16 times more powerful than the Grand Coulee was.

Better than that, the environmental impact is next to nonexistent.  The dam was once referred to as green energy but it destroyed the watershed.  The most obvious impact was eliminating salmon spawning grounds.  But they’re numerous knock-on impacts that we still don’t fully understand.  The dam’s been gone for over a decade now and the fish are just starting to come back.

What’s really cool about the dam being gone — I’ve always been a Lewis and Clark fan.  For the first time in over a century you can now boat their route, following the Columbia down to the Pacific.  Washington water trails have been building camp sites that let you go even past the Lewis and Clark route, all the way up to Wenatchee!  You can go out for weeks on the river now.”

“You mentioned the environmental impact.  What sort of waste does BC put out?”

“I wouldn’t really say any.  Though if you want to be exact about it, we can talk about the product of the reaction.  Fusion is fusing two atoms together.  Broadly speaking, it could be anything.  You could fuse any element together.  For instance carbon is element 6 on the periodic table.  Fuse two of those guys together and you’ve got number 12 – magnesium.

“The sun is a giant fusion reactor.  Deep down in its depths, it’s making some of those heavier elements.  As it ages, it’ll do that more and more until the weight of them kills it, and us if we’re still around.  Of course the BC doesn’t go in for that kind of stuff.  It focuses on the most common kind of fusion in the universe, making hydrogen into helium.”

Keith led Aaron down a crushed rock path looping around the BC.  As they neared a junction, Keith pointed to a 10 cm pipe that branched into a tree root system of ever smaller pipes all connected to the top of the reactor.  Reaching away from the reactor, the larger pipe disappeared into a small metal shed, not at all unlike a shiny outhouse.

“Here’s our helium capture.  This is, if it can be called it, our main waste product.”

“That doesn’t sound so bad.”

“Broadly speaking, it’s not.  In early reactors, helium would build up and cause components to fail.  We’ve gotten better at extracting it though.  Initially we vented it.  But, we’ve realized there’s a market, so we capture it and resell it.  The blimp guys love it, what with it being rather less flammable than hydrogen.”

“Helium production is actually a big unexpected boon that way.  Up until the 2020’s the government actually had a strategic helium reserve.  That’s down to the stuff being both in short supply and irreplaceable.  Once mined, it has a tendency to float away into the upper atmosphere, never to be seen again.”
