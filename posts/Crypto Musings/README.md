## Crypto Musings

I don't get crypto.

It was orignally pitched as a currency.  But no one used it to buy anything.

Then it was a store of value.  But it's value flucuates wildly and it has zero intrinsic value.  Even gold is better.

Then NFT thing happened.  Supposedly you were buying the rights to sad little bitmaps that make Diesel Sweeties look like the product of renaisance masters.  As if that weren't bad enough, you didn't even end up owning you bitmap.  Instead you owned a crypto thingy saying you owned a URL where your bitmap was hosted.  People could freely copy said bitmap and create their own NFT saying they owned it.  The whole thing deeply confused me.

Somewhere in there we were going to use the blockchain for provenance, ledgers and so on.  But it turns out the approach that's been working since the invention of writing is better.

With all those previous attempts to come up with a use case largely failed, crypto is now going to revolutionize the web.  I totally agree that web 2 is deeply flawed, a terrible walled garden.  I don't see any way that bolting crypto onto it fixes anything.

Reading about [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/), I totally love the distributed idea.  The notion that one can copy the whole network is interesting.  Though, I'd think a decentralized model would scale better without a Facebook to run it.

[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) seems similar.

From there I stumbled on to [Dune](https://dune.com/).

I just don't get it.  I want to believe.  But I can't figure out why I should.

Farcaster actually seems pretty reasonable.  I just don't get the advantage of the crypto in it.  I do get the crypto disadvantage.  It seems you need to pay $5 to get an account.

One positive thing I could see --- early on in the web there was a notion that micropayments would make the news go.  Rather than a $10/month subscription, the NYT was supposed to charge $0.05 per article or something like that.  It clearly never happened.  The model instead is chunky subscriptions that vendors hope users forget to cancel.  That's not something consumers likely want as evidenced by the uptake in serverless cloud services over dedicated IaaS.

Perhaps crypto could ensure that a browsing device does some work to pay for the content its consuming.  That could make writing a more profitable endevour.  In a perfect world it might revitilatize the approach once taken by Amazing Stories, Analog and such.
