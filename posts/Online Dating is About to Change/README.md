Social networks provide minimal support for choosing what online persona you project where.  Facebook has its byzantine privacy settings and [ever changing terms of service](http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/11/technology/social/facebook-search-privacy/), Google has circles and [wants to use your pictures in advertisements](http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/11/4827372/google-ads-using-your-name-picture-to-sell-products).  It seems a pretty clear bet those services will only open up more.

Contrast that with online dating.  Using a real name isn't required and in many cases is actually inadvisable.  That said, posting a picture dramatically increases the chance of receiving a reply.

So, assuming you want some anonymity, what picture should you post?

Clearly using your Facebook profile picture is not a way to ensure any degree of privacy.  A fairly simple crawler could compare personal photos with Facebook photos.

Even using a different picture might not guarantee privacy.  Facial recognition is getting pretty good.

One popular strategy, especially for adult personals is to take a picture of your torso or some other body part.  Often these pictures show tattoos or nice views of someone's bathroom at home.  Take a look at [casual encounters on craigslist](http://seattle.craigslist.org/search/cas?query=w4m&zoomToPosting=&minAsk=&maxAsk=&hasPic=1) for some great examples.  How hard would it be to use machine learning to match the bathroom clutter in your sexually explicit craigslist advertisement with the bathroom clutter in that cute photo of your cat?

Things are not looking good for privacy.

It's easy to imagine some interesting apps coming out of this.  One would be a sidebar for every dating site out there.

Google (or its successor) is also going to get a bit more advanced.  In addition to searching text, the search engine of the future will allow you to search images and video as well.  Yes, I know you can type some text into a youtube search box and get a result.  That's nothing.

In the brave new world you'll be able to point your camera phone at somebody on the street and get their social networking profiles including those pesky dating sites.
