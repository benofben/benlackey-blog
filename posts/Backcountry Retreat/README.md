## Backcountry Ski and Art Retreat

My backcountry Ski and Art Retreat campaign just went live.  Go take a look!

For years we've been talking about building a retreat high up in the mountains where we could spend the days wandering around and reading.  The cost and maintenance made it really difficult.

Crowd funding might provide a way around those issues...

### Winter

Are you tired of resort skiing?  Want to ski backcountry?

Backcountry skiing as practiced in the US is kind of crap.  You get up at the ass-end of dawn and then drive for several hours until you find a suitable spot to begin trudging up the hill.  Exhausted lunch at the top and then one run back to the car so you can get on the interstate again and drive home (probably behind a shocking number of people coming back from Vail).

Imagine instead heading into the woods for a couple days.  You skin ~5mi up to your cabin for the weekend.  You lay down all your stuff and take a brief nap on an actual bed.  Maybe go grab a coffee or a glass of wine and the central lodge.

Then go out for a nice day trip.  Pop to the top of the mountain (~14k) and then back down to the lodge.  Feeling tired but still have a little more energy?  No problem.  Hike up again and then collapse on the bed in your cabin.  

So, that's all perfect if you're in the Denver area.  What if you're out of town?  

Same deal - fly in and drive to the retreat from nearby Denver International Airport.  Stay a week or two in relative comfort (no megamid tents without floors) and then disappear back to where ever you came from (I'm looking at you London).

### Summer
Have you been living in NY/London/Berlin/too big city for too long?  Is it 100 degrees down in Boulder and Denver?

This is a nice place to get away.  Summers in the Colorado mountains are temperate with afternoon storms.  The weather changes quickly and there are lots of nice mountains to hike up.

At the retreat you'll have your own cabin to get away and enjoy solitude.  There will be a central lodge where you can cook and chat with others.

### Some Background
Over the next decade, we're going to run a lottery to determine which contributors what days at the retreat.  However, for the first year the pick of days will be determined by the order your contribution posted.  So, if you contribute earlier, you'll get to pick better days to spend at the retreat.

### Risks and Challenges
Our major risk is unexpected construction costs. We've collected estimates for the various costs anticipated. As I've learned from other construction projects, contractors often run over. We've built a contingency in, but that may prove insufficient.

If the crowd funding generates sufficient capital, we may be able to finance a portion of this, leaving more capital for contingency.

If this works, we'd like to try running another one of these, but based in the Pacific Northwest somewhere.
