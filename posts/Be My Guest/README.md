I have a personal relationship with Conrad Hilton.  It developed well after his death.  I used to stay at Starwood Hotels.  When I lived in England, I began staying at Hiltons because they were all over Europe, whereas Starwood coverage was far more sparse.

I now spend a lot of time staying at Hiltons, and I quite like it.  At some point I started reading business biographies and picked up Be My Guest by Conrad Hilton.  I was hooked.  I stayed at Hiltons every chance I could.  I got the credit card.  I even started reading the histories of the hotels on the bedside stand.

My image of Conrad Hilton built over the years.  Beyond the biography, Mad Men had a great depiction of him that fit well with my picture.  I read more about the hotels at every stop and even recall a lovely conversation at the bar with a Director at Intercontinental Hotels (while dining at Ca Va) where he attempted to pry me from Hilton without success.  Even the disgusting excess of Paris Hilton couldn’t pry me from my love of Conrad Hilton’s ideals.

Hilton’s autobiography has a great story about his quest to buy the Stevens Hotel, now called the Hilton Chicago.  During that quest he ended up acquiring the Palmer House as well, another property I love and have very fond memories of.  However, my favorite story about the Hilton Chicago comes from that book on the bedside stand…

Pardon my retelling from memory, but this doesn’t seem to have made it to the web -- During the DNC riots in 1968 hotel management requested the doors be locked to keep the rioters out.  There was no key to be found.  The front door of the hotel had remained unlocked for decades, welcoming all.  To me that is what a hotel should be.

So, I was a bit sad tonight when I came back to the Garden Inn in Toronto to find the front door locked with two people at the front desk.  I pulled on the door and one of the receptionists waved a key at me rather than unlocking the door for me.  I got my key out, but was pretty peeved and gave an impromptu lecture on the Chicago incident.  I suspect it won’t change hotel policy.  Still, I have my ideal of what a Hilton should be.

And, I’m funny about brands that way.  There are a few, Brooks Brothers, REI, Feathered Friends that I have a fierce loyalty to.  Incidentally, I added another today.  For about five years I’ve bought 1-2 Plantronics headsets a year.  I probably spend 20+ hours a week on the things.  I kill them and lose them pretty frequently.

Earlier today I was wandering around the conference I’m attending this week and poked around briefly at the Jabra and Sennheiser booths, wondering idly if I should try one of those next time my Plantronics disappears in an airplane seat.  A bit later, I was sitting outside the conference, chatting on a customer call with the Plantronics in my ear.  A man walked up and handed me his business card.  On it were the words “Thank you for your business.”

There is no way Plantronics is losing my business.  The VP who handed that to me just cemented a customer for life.

So, two stories -- one positive and one negative.  In each case a small act has a huge impact on perception of the brand.  In my role, I often forget how important these small acts can be.  Customers matter.  Customer impressions are formed organically and in the most subtle ways.  It’s so important to ensure their experience is always good, pre sale, post sale and even when a person isn't a viable prospect.

Today gave me a new appreciation for what excellent marketing can do.
