I called after three blue Superformances.  They'd all sold.  At that point I was debating a brand new one from the dealer for $100k when I decide to dip my toe in with a black one that had been on the market for a while.  Jeff bought it for $71k three years prior.  During that time it sat in a rickety garage in Greenville South Carolina.  He put a total of 600 miles on it during the time he ownen it.  He listed it for $69k earlier in the summer.  By the time I called he was at $64,900.  We agreed on $60k sight unseen.

One realization I had on this is that the cars are hard to finance and expensive.  So acting as a private seller means there's a lot more friction.  You need someone with cash.  That plus the South Carolina location meant he was a motivated seller.

I'm the third owner of the car, SPO 1778.  I was originally silver with a black stripe.  The original owner repainted it all black.  It's got a 460 in it.  Oddly the Superformance paperwork has a mix of 351 and 460 in it, so not sure what happened there.

After sleeping at a hotel in Greenville, I met up with Jeff and Edi and took the car for a drive.  I'd never been in one of these before.  It clearly had a ridicuous amount of power.  Jeff warned me that the clutch was stiff, but it really didn't seem that bad.  What I noticed instead was the gas was super stiff.  Also the seat wasn't on sliders.  I read later that was a big and tall build for people 6'5" and 250lb.  Both Jeff and I are around 5'10"...  Jeff said he just slouched and sat super low.

Jeff also noted that he'd never driven the car in the rain, though I noticed later it had some rust, probably due to the relatively unsealed garage and South Carolina humidity.  As I left the bank, I think he was pretty horrified I was going to go into a rain storm.  He and Edi kept asking if I were sure I didn't want to ship it.

The car is terrifying in the rain.  At one point somewhere north of Greenville I pulled over and put the top on.  It became clear the windows were bent and the little side windows wouldn't accomodate even an unbent window.  Jeff said he never used them, though I marvel that he never looked in the bag.  Who knows...  Regardless, I built the top like a little tent and drove to Ashville, NC sans windows.  There I picked a hotel with a parking garage (at least that's what the website said).  When I pulled up, the sign said valet only but the valet wanted no part of it.  The hotel garage also turned out to be a myth.  He suggested a public garage across the street.

Dinner was Benne and Eagle, a fancy southern place.  I ordered poorly for entrees, though the Hummingbird Cake was fantastic.
